This is my entry for Ludum Dare 51

## It's Snake, But Every 10 Seconds The Food Turns Into Walls
The title says it all.

## How To Play
You, the player, takes control of the snake, which is always moving foward.  You can change the direction the snake moves, but you can't make it stop moving.  Your objective is to eat the food blocks to gain points.  Eating food will also incrase the length of the snake by 1.  However, should you collide with either yourself or a wall block, then it's game over.
